Project that consists of scraping data from the website: https://www.aosfatos.org/

This project was done through a live broadcast on the Eduardo Mendes channel, in which I produced what the professor was doing with the aim of learning about data scraping and the best techniques.

The project was not finished, only reaching 1 hour and 20 minutes of the live.
